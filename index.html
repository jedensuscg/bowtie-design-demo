            <h2>Is your company</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <button>Who We Are</button>
            <p>We are Harry and Sally, a pair of Doctors who turned their love of bowties and passion for creating into
                a business. We started selling bowties locally, and became known for our quality and attention to
                detail. We eventually bought a wharehouse, and scaled our business to the largest custome bowtie botique
                on the web. </p>
            <button>What We Do</button>
            <p>We handcraft every bowtie we ship. We personally vet and train every employer who works for us, so that
                each and every bowtie is crafted with the same combination of exacting standards and personal touch that
                you would recieve from us. Even Harry and Sally frequent still frequently create bowties for our
                customers.</p>
            <img src="images/bowtie-making.png" class="img-fluid" alt="making a bowtie">
            <button>What We Believe</button>
            <p>We believe that there is no occasion where a bowtie can not be proudly worn. From a traditional black tie
                affair, or a saturday night at the club. We also believe that bowties are inherently personal, and that
                each bowtie should reflect the wearers personality and style. This is why we feel that the only way to
                craft a bowtie, is to craft it by hand, with input from the person who will end up wearing it. You tell
                us what you want, and we will handcraft it, for you and no one else. There are no robotic machines or
                bulk sewing machines in our wharehouse, only small, hand operated machines that your grandmother might
                have used.</p>
